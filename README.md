My Pacman mod themed after the 4th episode of Kemono Friends.

You play as Tsuchinoko in her Underground Labyrinth, collecting Sandstar and occasionally eating blue Japari buns as the colourful ceruleans pursue you.

The game has two modes, the default one is classic and is just that, the original Pacman with little modifications, for training purposes. The real game starts once you enable Japari Mode. This is where the new game tech emerges - the Fog of War, that limits the visibility by direct sight. Fortunately, as we might remember from the series, Tsuchinoko has IR-vision, so you will not be completely in the dark regarding the enemy movements.

Beware of the barred walls, for you can't go through them while Ceruleans can and there will be more of those unexpected passages with every level. Make use of the vantage points - Ceruleans can't go up to high places. Should you find yourself in a pinch, be sure to summon Friends to help you, provided that you've found their items and have Japari Coins. Kaban will reveal the map for a while and Serval will protect you from cerulean attacks.

Let's see how well you can do in this reimagined classic, the highscores are tracked and the leaderboards are available after beating level 5.
